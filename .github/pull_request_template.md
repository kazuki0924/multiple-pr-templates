<!-- NOTICE!!

There are several pull request templates available. Please use one of them if it suits your needs!

Unfortunately, GitHub has not made it easy for us to use them. To use a pull request template, after you have the branches that you want to create the pull request for, simply modify the url. 

If there is already a `?` at the end of the URL (i.e. parameters are being passed to the pull request), add a `&` to the end of the url -- DO NOT HIT ENTER YET

If there is not a `?` at the end of the URL, add a `?` to the end of the URL -- DO NOT HIT ENTER YET

Now, add `template=TEMPLATE_NAME.md` where the `TEMPLATE_NAME` is one of

* template1
  * This template shows the use of a checkbox list
* template2
  * This template shows the use of a table

After you have finished specifying the template, you can finally hit enter and the template will appear!

*More templates will be added to this list as they are made available*
